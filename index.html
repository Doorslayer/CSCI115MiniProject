            Chess is a game that has been around for thousands of years. This website is designed to be a basic overview of simple, fundamental ideas that any chess player should be
            aware of. There are three ways to win a game of chess: Your opponent resigning, your opponent running out of time (provided you're playing with a timer), and checkmate.
            Checkmate is where your opponents king is under attack (this is called check), and the opponent has no way of getting the king out of check. There are five ways
            for a game of chess to end in a draw: Draw offer, insufficient material, three-fold repetition, the fifty move rule, and stalemate. A draw offer is where one player 
            offers a draw, and the other player agrees to it. Insufficient material is where neither player has enough pieces to be able to checmate the opponent. Three-fold 
            repetition is when a both players make the same cycle of moves three times in a row, after which either player may claim a draw. The fifty move rule where the game ends 
            in a draw if fifty moves go by without either player capturing a piece or making a pawn move. Stalemate is where a player can't make any moves, but is not in check.
