            <p>
                Pawns can move one space forwards, and capture pieces one space diagonally forwards. Pawns can NOT capture pieces directly in front of them. Additionally if it's the 
                first move a pawn has made this game they may move two spaces forwards rather than just one. Pawns have a piece value of 1. Although pawns are the weakest, least 
                valuable piece on the board, they are still very important!

            <h2 id="bishops">Bishops</h2>
            <p>
                Bishops can move an unlimited amount of spaces in any diagonal direction. Bishops have a piece value of 3. Although they're less valuable than rooks, 
                they're easier to get out in the early game, and since they're less valuable, you can use them in sacrifices and tactics more easily and more often than rooks.

            <h2 id="rooks">Rooks</h2>
            <p>
                Rooks can move an unlimited amount of spaces in any orthogonal direction. Rooks have a piece value of 5. Rooks are strong pieces when used both defensively 
                and offensively, and are very powerful pieces in the endgame since they're so good at restricting the opponent's king's movement.

            <h2 id="knights">Knights</h2>
            <p>
                Knights move in an "L" shape (two spaces in one orthogonal direction then one in a perpindicular direction). Knights also can't be blocked by other pieces since they
                are allowed to "jump over" them. Knights have a piece value of 3. Although knights can be tricky to get the hang of, they are very strong offensive pieces since they
                can't be blocked.

            <h2 id="queen">Queen</h2>
            <p>
                Queens can move an unlimited amount of spaces diagonally or orthogonally. Queens have a piece value of 9. Although queens are powerful pieces, that also makes them
                vulnerable since most trades involving your queen are going to be favourable for your opponent, so its important to keep your queen out of danger.

            <h2 id="king">King</h2>
            <p>
                The king can move one space in any orthogonal or diagonal direction. The king may not move into check. Although it's important to protect your king, you shouldn't
                be afraid to use it for offense in the endgame, as it can be a useful tool when you're ahead.
