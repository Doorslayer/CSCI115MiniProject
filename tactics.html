            <p>
                A fork is where a piece is attacking two pieces which are either of higher value or unprotected simultaneously. This ensures that you're getting a free piece or a
                favourable trade no matter what the opponent does. Knights are most commonly used for forks since they can't be taken by the pieces they're attacking unless it's 
                another knight.

            <p>
                A pin is where you move a piece so that one of your opponents pieces is blocking you from taking a more valuable piece behind it. This means that the opponent can't 
                move that piece since it would mean losing the piece behind it. This can be useful in restricting your opponents pieces and can lead to your opponent making more 
                mistakes.

            <p>
                A skewer is kind of like a mix of a pin and a fork. Rather than moving so that a less powerful piece is between you and a more powerful piece, you move so that a more 
                powerful piece is between you and a less powerful one. This forces your opponent to move the more powerful piece, allowing you to take the other one.
